# Fun-Math-Game
A fun math arcade game written in jQuery

# How To Play
* In this math game, you have five seconds to compare two mathematical expressions. You have to decide if
* The number on the left is greater than the number on the right
* The two numbers are equal
* Or the number on the left is less than the number on the right
* There will be three buttons, representing greater_than(`>`), equals(`=`) or less_than(`<`)

# Levels
* As with most arcade games, the longer you play, the higher the difficulty.
* `Level 1`: Mathematical expressions involve numbers less than 10
* `Levels 2 - 3`: Mathematical expressions involve negative numbers greater than -10 and positive numbers less than 20
* `Levels 4 - 5`: Mathematical expressions involve negative numbers greater than -100 and positive numbers less than 100
* `Levels 6 - 7`: Mathematical expressions now involve subtraction, multiplication or division
* `Levels 8+`: It's next to impossible to reach this level without cheating
